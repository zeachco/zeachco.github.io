		</p>
		<h2>What kind of engineer am I</h2>
		<p>
			I am a JavaScript/Node.js developer with expertise in code quality, and technical debt
			management. Instead of throwing in a few hundred buzzwords, I invite you to find the specific
			skills you require from my skill page <a href="/skills">here</a>. These skills help me deal
			with the constant evolution of technologies.
		</p>

		<h3>A little bit about me</h3>
		<p>
			I wear many hats but identify primarily as a developer. Over the past {jsExpYears} years, I have
			specialized in JavaScript, working on a variety of projects including payment platforms, analytics
			dashboards, video games, 3D showcases, VR, complex server farms (with Node.js), middlewares and
			reverse proxies, command-line interface tools, deployment servers, test frameworks, and domain
			registrar systems.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am passionate about technological advancements, the Unix environment, Git, web stacks, and
			what I like to call "software philosophy." Over the years, I have slowly drifted towards the
			architectural portion of my work and team management, but I always come back to writing code.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have spent around {incExpYears} years building and experimenting with small businesses and startup
			structures, building my own company, and reinventing my products. Sadly, I am not a good salesperson,
			but the process of learning and bringing various complex projects to life month after month was
			so exciting that I couldn't stop.
		</p>

		<h3>Adaptability</h3>
		<p>
			With my fluency in English and French, as well as some proficiency in Spanish, Portuguese, and
			German, I am confident in my ability to communicate effectively with colleagues and clients
			from diverse backgrounds.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a passionate and experienced software developer, I have cultivated a strong interest in
			open source communities and have contributed to various projects on platforms such as GitHub.
			I am also well-versed in Linux, JavaScript, and Git.
		</p>
		<p>
			Furthermore, I am inspired by companies such as Netflix for their infrastructure, AirBnB,
			Stripe, and Shopify for their contributions to open source, and Walmart, Netflix, Dominos and
			Microsoft for being NodeJs pioneers. I am particularly drawn to the way these companies have
			been able to innovate and push boundaries in the tech industry.
		</p>
		<h3>Personality</h3>
		<p>
			Personality-wise, I love snowboarding, electronic music, dancing, computer games, general
			learning, and innovation. I am also an early adopter when it comes to technological gadgets
			and lifestyle.
		</p>
		<h2>Fun projects, all the time!</h2>
		<p>
			An example of a fun project I've made is <a
				href="https://zeachco.github.io/phantom-game-ai-training/?game=highway">Highway</a
			>, an in-browser machine learning trainer that trains 2D cars to drive on a highway. Be aware
			that the first iterations are CPU-intensive, but the AI should learn to drive in less than 15
			minutes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Disclaimer: This project works better on small resolutions since rendering the multiple layers
			of neural networks takes a tool on retina displays and wide screens.
		</p>
		<p>
			There's also <a href="https://yenom.up.railway.app/">Yenom</a>!<br />
			{yenom.note}
		</p>
		<h3>Much more projects</h3>
		<h2>More things</h2>
		<p>
			If you're curious check out my <a href="https://github.com/zeachco">Github profile</a>. I also
			produce music and games on the side. I am also a big fan of Open Source and have contributed
			to many projects over the years.
